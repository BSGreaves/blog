# NSS Blog Exercise

### Description:

##### This was our first Nashville Software School task, the html/css equivalent of "Hello World". We had to: 

Build a basic blog page that has 5 articles and any random topics you want to talk about. The text can be anything, even placeholder text ( look at this lorem ipsum text generator for an example of the official unofficial gibberish of web developers everywhere ).

- There should be a page header containing the blog's title.
- There should be a page footer containing the copyright notice. View 2. pretty much any web site to see an example.
- Each article has a header containing a title.
- Each article has a footer containing the author and publication date.
- Each article has at least one section.

### Result:

##### Intentionally bad
